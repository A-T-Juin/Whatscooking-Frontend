# WhatsCooking

This repository is for the frontend portion of WhatsCooking. It is a social media platform for discovering and sharing recipes that is built on GraphQL.

## Motivation

This project was conceived by my love for cooking and urge to learn more about GraphQL. I constantly search for new things to whip up in the kitchen, but often times, I struggle with *what* to cook. To solve this, I would first go to a website that has plenty of food images (to spark an interest) *then* I would need to go to a separate site to find a recipe for that dish. This is the process that I wanted to simplify with WhatsCooking -- an application that can both showcase many different images of food in an aesthetic way, while providing clear directions on how to create it.
